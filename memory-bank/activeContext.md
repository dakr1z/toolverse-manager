# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the "Analysis & Documentation" phase. I have just established the Memory Bank to ensure consistent context for future tasks. The immediate goal was to understand the existing codebase and document it.

## Recent Changes
- **Infrastructure**: Initialized Git repository.
- **Features**: Added "Test Connection" button for Firebase in Settings.
- **Fixes**: Updated Gemini model to `gemini-1.5-flash` to fix AI generation errors.
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Established `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md` to map out the project.

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation First**: Before making code changes, a solid understanding of the current architecture (especially the monolithic `App.tsx` and data flow) was required.

## Next Steps
- Monitor GitHub Actions deployment status.
- Verify AI features with valid API Key.
- Potential areas for improvement identified:
  - **Refactoring `App.tsx`**: Breaking down the giant component into smaller contexts or hooks.
